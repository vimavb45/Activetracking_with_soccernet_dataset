        * A dataflow is an iterable. The :meth:`__iter__` method should yield a list each time.
          Each element in the list should be either a number or a numpy array.
          For now, tensorpack also **partially** supports dict instead of list.

        * The :meth:`__iter__` method can be either finite (will stop iteration) or infinite
          (will not stop iteration). For a finite dataflow, :meth:`__iter__` can be called
          again after the previous call returned.

        * For many dataflow, the :meth:`__iter__` method is non-reentrant, which means for an dataflow
          instance ``df``, :meth:`df.__iter__` cannot be called before the previous
          :meth:`df.__iter__` call has finished (iteration has stopped).
          If a dataflow is non-reentrant, :meth:`df.__iter__` should throw an exception if
          called before the previous call has finished.
          If you need to use the same dataflow in two places, you can simply create two dataflow instances.

        * It returns an integer representing the size of the dataflow.
          The return value **may not be accurate or meaningful** at all.
          When it's accurate, it means that :meth:`__iter__` will always yield this many of datapoints.

        * There could be many reasons why :meth:`__len__` is inaccurate.
          For example, some dataflow has dynamic size.
          Some dataflow mixes the datapoints between consecutive passes over
          the dataset, due to parallelism and buffering.
          In this case it does not make sense to stop the iteration anywhere.

        * Due to the above reasons, the length is only a rough guidance. Inside
          tensorpack it's only used in these places:

          + A default ``steps_per_epoch`` in training, but you probably want to customize
            it yourself, especially when using data-parallel trainer.
          + The length of progress bar when processing a dataflow.
          + Used by :class:`InferenceRunner` to get the number of iterations in inference.
            In this case users are **responsible** for making sure that :meth:`__len__` is accurate.

            int: rough size of this dataflow.

          e.g., initialize random number generators (RNG), create worker processes.

          Because it's very common to use RNG in data processing,
          developers of dataflow can also subclass :class:`RNGDataFlow` to have easier access to an RNG.
