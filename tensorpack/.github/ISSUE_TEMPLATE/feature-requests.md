about: Suggest an idea for Tensorpack

---

+ Note that you can implement a lot of features by extending Tensorpack
  (See http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#extend-tensorpack).
  It does not have to be added to Tensorpack unless you have a good reason.

+ "Could you improve/implement an example/paper ?"
  -- The answer is: we have no plans to do so. We don't consider feature
  requests for examples or implement a paper for you, unless it demonstrates 
  some Tensorpack features not yet demonstrated in the existing examples.
  If you don't know how to do something yourself, you may ask a usage question.
